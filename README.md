# Nether Bot Code

### Note

This bot is entirely used for the [World of Nether](https://discord.gg/Gar3Bzyufm) discord and is not intended and will not be used outside of it.
If you are a developer of this bot, there are a few things to keep in mind of.

### Information Necessary

- Basic understanding of task and how the code already implemented works for the most part.
- The ability to self-learn and primarily teach yourself in the process.
- Being able to have decent formatting and not much repetitiveness or unnecessarily long code.
- Knowing you can have fun coding, not just being annoyed/giving up at the code 24/7.

### Command Prompt Information

`Restarting the bot can also be ran using the the restart command for the bot, and it should save your data.`

- Start: `npm run start`
- Stop: `npm run stop`
- Status: `npm run status`

### Warnings

- Leaking anything of significant importance (like the token) will result in an immediate stop to development of this bot.
- Running malicious and or very API spammy code intentionally without warning can result in a stop to development of this bot.

More will be added here later on.
